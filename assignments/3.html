            <p>When you <em>join</em> two or more datasets, you combine them feature-by-feature, and this often gives attributes to a feature that it would not have otherwise had.</p>
            <p><strong>Attribute joins</strong> add attributes to features based on a <strong>unique identifier</strong>. Often you will have a spatial dataset (such as a shapefile) and a CSV file with extra data that you would like to map. As long as both the spatial data and the CSV have a common unique identifier (sometimes this is a name, but it could be a unique number or an address) you can join them in QGIS and add the data from the CSV to the spatial data.</p>
            <p>Use attribute joins to help your council member with the following:</p>

                <p>Hi again map-maker,</p>
                <p>Now that you're getting settled in, we'd like to get a better look at our council district using census data. In particular, let's start with <strong>renter occupancy</strong> or <strong>median household income</strong> (your choice) by census tract. Make the focus our district, but please show the surrounding area, too, for context.</p>
                <p>Thanks as always!</p>
            </div>
            <p>Download census data using <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/">American FactFinder</a>, join with the <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_tracts.html">census tracts</a>, and make a choropleth map with some of the joined data. Choose which data to get:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>renter vs owner occupancy
                    <ol>

                        <li>Occupancy Characteristic &gt; Owner/Renter (Tenure in Occupied Units)</li>
                        <li>Get <strong>census tracts</strong> for the <strong>county or counties</strong> your district is in</li>
                        <li>At "Are you looking for data for a race or ethnic group (race, ancestry, or tribe)?" you can select <strong>Skip this Step</strong></li>
                        <li>Select "TENURE"</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>household income

                        <li>"I'm looking for information about people"</li>
                        <li>Income &amp; Earnings &gt; Income/Earnings (Households)</li>
                        <li>Get <strong>census tracts</strong> for the <strong>county or counties</strong> your district is in</li>

                        <li>Select "MEDIAN INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2016 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS) "</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>For both, you'll want to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Modify Tables &gt; Transpose Rows / Columns</li>
                <li>Download &gt; Use this data</li>
                <li>Edit the resulting CSV</li>
