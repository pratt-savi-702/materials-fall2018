            <h2>Guidelines</h2>
            <p>The final project counts for 40% of your grade for this course. It is an opportunity to use the skills you have learned in this course in service of a theme you are interested in.</p>
            <p>Pick a part of New York or some other part of the world and a mappable theme and make ten maps of that area and your theme.</p>
            <p>All final projects <strong>must</strong> consist of the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>a theme that ties your maps/analyses together</li>
                    <li>a number of maps around your theme</li>
                    <li>a 10 to 15-minute presentation</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>The maps you make should use a variety of the techniques covered in this class. For example, this could include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>One</strong> map with your selected area highlighted for geographic context (that is, to show the area in its regional context).</li>
                    <li><strong>One</strong> basemap of your selected area highlighting points of interest.</li>
                    <li><strong>One</strong> population density map of your selected area.</li>
                    <li><strong>Two</strong> other maps based on census variables.</li>
                    <li><strong>One</strong> map using geocoding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Two</strong> maps using geoprocessing and/or spatial analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Two</strong> other maps highlighting your theme.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Submitting your work</h2>
            <p>The project is due <strong>December 13 at midnight</strong>.</p>
            <p>At the end of the class we will make a portfolio for the class together. This will be a quick way to show others what happened in the class and for everyone to share their outcomes with each other. The portfolio site will be very similar to <a href="https://pratt-savi-702.github.io/summer2016/">this one created for summer 2016</a>.</p>
            <p>You will submit your project through a Google Form, including some screenshots and a few paragraphs about the work.</p>
