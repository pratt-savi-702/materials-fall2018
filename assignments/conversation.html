                <h1>Map Conversation</h1>
            </header>

            <section>
                <p>Pick a map that someone else made and lead a short (5- to 10-minute) in-class conversation about it. This can be a map you like or dislike, is old or current, online or offline, etc. The only real restriction is that you cannot pick a map presented already in class, either by the instructor or a fellow classmate.</p>
                <p>Specific questions you may want to ask include:</p>
                <h3>Design choices</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is the map's design effective?</li>
                    <li>Does the map follow cartographic conventions as you understand them?</li>
                    <li>How could the map's design be better?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Data</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Are the map's data sources listed?</li>
                    <li>If the map's data was modified, is this described?</li>
                    <li>Do you trust the data the map contains?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Point of view</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does the map make a statement?</li>
                    <li>If so, could the statement have been make more effectively?</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Grading</h2>
                <p>This assignment is meant to be a conversation starter, so as long as you submit a map and talk about it by the end of the semester you will receive full credit.</p>
                <h2>Submitting your work</h2>
                <p>Email me a link to the map or attach it if it is not online (eg, if you are scanning it from a book or another source). You'll be given in-class time to lead a conversation about the map in the order of submission.</p>
                <h2>Deadline</h2>
                <p>Since we need to wrap these up before final project presentations, the last people to present these need to do so by <strong>December 5</strong>. I may assign class sessions randomly to students if it looks like we will miss this deadline.</p>
